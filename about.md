# About

I'm experimenting with Three.js.

Generally speaking I'm probably recreating work that's been done elsewhere, better, but I find it a lot easier to internalize things I do or figure out for myself. Along the way I'm trying to remember to add instructive comments, both so I can look back at what I've done and remember why I did it, and with the thought that, maybe, someone flipping through this code might find something of some use to them.

That said: it's all just me doing stuff and comes with absolutely no warranty whatsoever.

This actually started as a subset of my [canvas element sketchbook](https://darby3.github.io/canvas-sketchbook/) but I decided to branch this off to keep things separate. For some reason. I'm not exactly sure if this was a good idea yet or not.

There's also a [Three.js starters](https://darby3.github.io/threejs-starters/) repo which is less riffy and more like "if you need to do a thing, here is a specific way to do the thing."

## Methodology

It's a lot of...do a thing...then copy it and modify it. Do, modify. Do, modify.

Sometimes I set out on a path with a defined end-goal in mind, and I'll try to show my work, as it were. So it's less do-modify and more inch-toward-something-that-may-or-may-not-work-ever.

## The Experiments

I'm trying to annotate these a bit, without worrying too much about naming things, hence the numerical naming conventions. It's sort of like a big sketchbook that way.
